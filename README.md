# flow-balance-optimizer

a combinatorial optimization algorithm: max flow followed by "balancing"

* selective provisioning of source items to sinks with respect to initial count and maximum capacity
* inspired by: http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/070314-SPMF-EE380.pdf

# TODO

* more comprehensive/precise tests
* benchmarking fixtures
* concurrency optimizations
* optimizations on bar balancing
